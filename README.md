# Inventory-Models
Simple models for EOQ and Safety Stock Calculations: 
I created these files to mirror the excel calculations. The models are for the Economic Order Quantity calculation (continuous review case)
followed by safety stock calculation for the continuous review case. The safety stock calculation includes computation of the fill rate and
helps see the difference between cycle service level (CSL) and fill rate (fr). The third model in the sequence is the Periodic Review model.
The Alko model is to demonstrate the caculations for the Alko case.
I added the News Vendor Model to compute the Order Quantity for a seasonal product. I assume the demand distribution is normal.
